    "## Problem 1: Predict the Temperature\n",
    "- For the next weekend\n",
    "- For the same date as today but next year\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characterization\n",
    "1. **Function:** This problem can be modeled as a regression problem where the goal is to predict a continuous value (temperature) based on other variables (like date, time, historical temperature data and geographical location).\n",
    "2. **Dynamic System:** Weather is inherently dynamic, with changes over time being significant. Therefore, this problem also fits into the dynamic system model where the current state (current weather conditions) influences future states (future temperatures).\n",
    "3. **Relevant Characteristics:**\n",
    "- Temporal data is crucial as historical weather patterns greatly inform predictions.\n",
    "- Geographical variables are also key as weather patterns vary significantly by location.\n",
    "- External factors like climate change might influence long-term predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible Solutions\n",
    "1. **Statistics**: \n",
    "- **Time Series Analysis:** Utilize statistical methods like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Prediction Model for short-term predictions (such as the next weekend). ARIMA is a statistical model that uses time series data to predict future trends and would be effective for short-term predictions.\n",
    "2. **Machine Learning**:\n",
    "- **Machine Learning Models:** Employ models like Random Forests or Neural Network, which can handle multiple variables and are effective for both short-term and long-term predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Solution\n",
    "Given the complexity of weather patterns, a combination of time series analysis and machine learning might offer the most robust solution. For next weekend's prediction, focus on short-term patterns and recent data. For next year's prediction, incorporate long-term trends and potential climatic shifts."
